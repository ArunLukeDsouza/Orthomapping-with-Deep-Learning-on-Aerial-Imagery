# Orthomapping-with-Deep-Learning-on-Aerial-Imagery

his project photogrammetrically corrects imagery from drones, satellites, digital photography and aerial photography to remove geometric distortion. These images can be used to generate Orthomosaics

The project was developed and tested using: 
• Python 3.8.2
• OpenCV 4.4.0
• Numpy 1.18.4

Feature detection and description is achieved using D2-Net. The D2-Net is a trainable CNN for joint description and detection of local features.
